                    </div>
                    <p align="justify" class="style5">  E-mail and Internet-related fraudulent schemes, such as &ldquo;phishing&rdquo;   (pronounced &ldquo;fishing&rdquo;), are being perpetrated with increasing frequency,   creativity and intensity. Phishing involves the use of seemingly legitimate   e-mail messages and websites to deceive consumers into disclosing sensitive   information, such as bank or loan account information, Social Security numbers,   credit card numbers, passwords, and personal identification numbers (PINs). The   perpetrator of the fraudulent e-mail message may use various means to convince   the recipient that the message is legitimate and from a trusted source with   which the recipient has an established business relationship. Techniques such as   a false &ldquo;from&rdquo; address or the use of seemingly legitimate company logos,   weblinks and graphics may be used to mislead e-mail recipients. </p>
                    <p align="justify" class="style5">In most phishing schemes, the fraudulent e-mail message   will request that recipients &ldquo;update&rdquo; or &ldquo;validate&rdquo; their financial or personal   information in order to maintain their accounts, and direct them to a fraudulent   website that may look very similar to the website of the legitimate business.   These websites may include copied or &ldquo;spoofed&rdquo; pages from legitimate websites to   further trick consumers into thinking they are responding to a bona fide   request. Some consumers will mistakenly submit financial and personal   information to the perpetrator who will use it to gain access to financial   records or accounts, commit identity theft or engage in other illegal acts. </p>
