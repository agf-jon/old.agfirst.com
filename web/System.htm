					<font size="2" face="Verdana,Geneva,Helvetica,Arial">Today, the <b>Farm Credit System</b> provides more than
                    $90 billion in loans to more than a half million borrowers, including farmers, ranchers, rural homeowners, agricultural cooperatives, rural utility systems and agribusinesses.<br>
					<br>
					Unlike commercial banks, system banks and associations do not take deposits. Instead, loanable funds are raised through the sale of Systemwide bonds and notes in the nation's capital markets.<br>
					<br>
					There are four regional Farm Credit Banks in the Farm Credit System,
                    and one Bank for Cooperatives. Typical services offered by the regional banks and associations include real estate loans, operating loans, rural home mortgage loans, credit-related life insurance, crop insurance and various financially related services such as farm record-keeping and financial planning.<br>
					<br>
					Long-term mortgage loans to farmers and ranchers are generally made by Farm Credit Banks, Federal Land Bank Associations or Federal Land Credit Associations. Short- and intermediate-term loans are generally made by Production Credit Associations. In some areas, these lending entities have combined to form Agricultural Credit Associations which provide both long- and short-term loans.<br>
