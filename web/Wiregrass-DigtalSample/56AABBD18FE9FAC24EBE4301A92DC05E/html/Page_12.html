Farm Credit <br />Supports Port City Rodeo! </div></div><br />For the third consecutive year, Southwest <br />Georgia Farm Credit proudly sponsored <br />the Port City Rodeo, to benefit the Deca- <br />tur County Family Connection. Southwest <br />Georgia Farm Credit staff served up some <br />delicious hot dogs and hamburgers, and got <br />some help from area high school students <br />who pitched in to sell everything from pro- <br />grams to cotton candy! <br />The Decatur County Family Connec- </div></div><br />tion serves area families by providing edu- <br />cational opportunities and a food backpack <br />program for children in need. </div><br />Coat and Blanket Drive Warms Our Hearts! </div></div><br />Ask Southwest Georgia Farm <br />Credit’s Stephanie Street- <br />man why she volunteers to <br />support the Association’s <br />annual Coat and Blanket <br />Drive, and she’ll tell you: “In <br />our communities, there is <br />a growing need, especially <br />among children, for coats to </div></div><br />12 Wiregrass Fall 2011 </div></div><br />keep them warm. If there’s a <br />need, we can help.” <br />Last year, Stephanie </div></div><br />worked with Family Con- <br />nection organizations in <br />Schley and Randolph coun- <br />ties to organize donations. <br />This year, in Schley Coun- <br />ty, the need to get coats </div></div><br />into the hands of needy <br />families was so great, they <br />started early. <br />“The hope is that when </div></div><br />it starts to get really chilly, <br />those in need have what <br />they need to keep warm, <br />Streetman said. </div>
