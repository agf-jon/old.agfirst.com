In a world where economic volatility and speed <br />of change are accelerating, the opportunities for success <br />are plentiful; however, the opportunities for failure are also <br />abundant. Proactive, strong leadership is essential to main- <br />tain focus. </div></div><br />Leaders at All Levels <br />Leadership can be demonstrated in many forms at all </div></div><br />levels given the situation or timing of an event. For some, <br />leadership is shown by providing guidance to a 4-H project <br />or FFA event, supporting the local rescue squad, or coaching <br />a football or basketball league. Serving on church, commu- <br />nity, or agricultural boards, or representing your industry <br />locally, regionally, or nationally can be a context for lead- <br />ership. Often an unusual event or emergency brings out <br />the best leadership qualities of everyday normal people. <br />However, for many the day-to-day interaction with family, <br />employees, suppliers, and the community shows evidence <br />of leadership and focus on success. <br />Great leadership is built on the art of communicating a </div></div><br />vision, core value, or principle. Moreover, it involves inspir- <br />ing a person or group of people with common values and <br />ideals to create and pursue within their personal skill sets. </div></div><br />The “Why” Connection <br />The foundation of great leadership is the “why” con- </div></div><br />nection. I recently watched a video of Simon Sinek on the <br />TEDTalks YouTube Channel in which he explained how <br />leaders inspire action through the power of “why.” (http:// <br />youtu.be/qp0HIF3SfI4) The main idea of his message was <br />that people connect with you when they believe what you <br />believe, or have a similar purpose, motivation, or “why.” <br />After sharing this video at a strategic planning conference <br />of an agricultural cooperative, I asked the group a simple <br />question. Why do you work for this particular agricultural <br />cooperative? Many in the group thought responses would <br />be picking up a paycheck or providing for the family. <br />To everyone’s surprise, we received a different set of </div></div><br />responses. Many felt that it was empowering to work with <br />farms engaged in producing food, fiber and fuel for a grow- <br />ing world population. Others stated they enjoyed having <br />coworkers with similar beliefs and a work environment <br />that is like family. Some stated their lives are enriched by <br />the challenge and fun of helping agricultural producers <br />solve problems. One person stated that he enjoys work- <br />ing in this business because the people are more important <br />than the quarterly financial bottom line. The special rela- <br />tionships that they have with their customers rank much <br />higher than a paycheck. </div><br />By Dr </div><br />. David Kohl <br />The leadership of this management team suddenly </div></div><br />realized that the connection between employees and cus- <br />tomers who have very similar “whys” set them beyond the <br />status quo of the competition. Knowing the “whys” took <br />them to another level. As a matter of fact, this organiza- <br />tion now has established a “why statement” that speaks <br />from the heart and goes beyond the traditional mission, vi- <br />sion, and core values. The same can apply to your situation <br />whether it is work, family, or a community setting. Effective <br />leaders are able to connect with people who have a similar <br />purpose, cause or belief. </div></div><br />Key Elements of Leadership <br />Over the years I have been in a position to exam- </div></div><br />ine many outstanding leaders while involved in athletics, <br />teaching, and facilitating numerous agricultural groups. <br />The following list, though not exhaustive, provides key ele- <br />ments of leadership that I have observed. <br />• Building a team on a single purpose, vision, and focus <br />• Knowing how to gain commitment of others with goals <br />and actions </div></div><br />• Creating an environment of empowerment <br />• Thinking and acting independently and creatively, but <br />also gaining consensus with balanced input </div></div><br />• Remaining believable and positive, while understand- <br />ing the capabilities of others </div></div><br />• Praising, reinforcing, critiquing, and sometimes work- <br />ing through others as agents of change </div></div><br />• Making others better, lifting, and enriching lives <br />Many great leaders never forget their roots; they are hum- </div></div><br />ble and always remember the people who got them where <br />they are today. Good leaders tend to be superior listeners and <br />observers of people’s verbal and nonverbal communication. <br />They know how to motivate others and realize that each indi- <br />vidual is unique, having special experiences and talents that, if <br />unlocked, can make them blossom. Outstanding leaders never <br />forget that change starts bottom-up, not top-down, and they <br />value people and input from the front lines. <br />What is fun to observe about great leaders is some are </div></div><br />fiery like Bob Knight, while others are quiet and subtle, but <br />passionate. One quality that all great leaders possess is the <br />ability to connect with people by establishing a common <br />purpose. Sometimes leaders can be subservient, or engaged <br />with people in an activity side-by-side, “walking the talk.” <br />However, they are keen on the art of connecting with the <br />minds and the hearts of others to further a common cause <br />with balance and common sense. <br />Agriculture and rural America have many of the old- </div></div><br />time values that have made America great. It is up to all of <br />us to be advocates for our industry and cultivate an environ- <br />ment that sets us beyond the status quo. Being leaders by <br />connecting and communicating the “whys” from our day- <br />to-day tasks on farms to working with families, employees, <br />consumers, and stakeholders in our industry is imperative <br />to lead the industry forward. Agriculture has been and will <br />always be the foundation of the pyramid of success of our <br />country. Are you ready to step up and be a leader? </div></div><br />Wiregrass Fall 2011 <br />9 </div>
