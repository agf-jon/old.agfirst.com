Federal laws will <br />change January 1, 2012, disallowing many of the favor- <br />able tax provisions currently in place. This year, the <br />value of a perpetual conservation easement donated <br />to a land trust or governmental unit can be deducted <br />as a charitable contribution up to 50% of the donor’s <br />adjusted gross income. </div></div><br />In 2012, deductions will be <br />limited to 30% of AGI with a five-year carry forward. </div>
