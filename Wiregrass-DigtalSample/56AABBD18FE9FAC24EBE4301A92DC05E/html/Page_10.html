But for those who <br />saw both—the beauty and the economic potential, pine for- <br />ests that stretched from Decatur and Thomas and Seminoles <br />counties to the Gulf of Mexico represented a way of life—a <br />recreational paradise and a source of economic stability for <br />the first half of the 20th century. <br />What’s left of that era are a few companies, Elberta Crate </div></div><br />and Box Company in Bainbridge being one, a relic of the saw- <br />milling days remembered by a few gentlemen who brought <br />the sawmill industry to life. J.E. Sharber is one of those men. </div></div><br />Sawmill Industry Brought </div></div><br />Economic Prosperity to the Region <br />There aren’t many business people in Decatur County </div></div><br />who haven’t heard of Joe (JE) Sharber. Over the course of <br />eight decades, Mr. Sharber has been influential in the busi- <br />ness community, with the running of his own business, Shar- <br />ber Oil, and as a trusted voice of reason. <br />Mr. Sharber’s experiences in the sawmill and timber </div></div><br />business aren’t unique in these parts—but his work ethic and <br />commitment to small town values might be. Once graduated <br />from high school JE set out to work his way up in the pine for- <br />ests surrounding Bainbridge and Seminole County, running a <br />sawmill and logging company for a number of years. Work- <br />ing for the L.P. Estes sawmill, J.E. quickly moved up the ranks, <br />at a time when our nation had an insatiable appetite for lum- <br />ber due to the war. </div></div><br />In fact, L.P. Estes’ sawmill was one of the </div></div><br />first to use a portable sawmill, perfect in many ways, but one <br />of the most important being that it would save on transpor- <br />tation costs. From the booklet, “The story of Decatur Coun- <br />ty’s Carpet of Green Gold,” local author Mayo Livingston, Jr., <br />writes: “At the management helm of this “pepper-box” mill <br />was a young teenager named James “Joe” Sharber. His fires of <br />ambition and strong work ethics would be formulated dur- <br />ing those years as he orchestrated the operations of the mill. <br />The stillness of the early morning would be shattered when <br />Joe would bring to life the giant diesel engine know as Buda. <br />It would be the roar of the diesel and the scream of the saw <br />that could be heard during the 10-hour work days. <br />“With Joe as the conductor and the diesel and saw fur- </div></div><br />nishing the music, the players of the orchestra would be the <br />sawyer, log turners, slab trippers, edger man, deck hand and <br />two men to handle the green lumber. From this orchestra <br />would be produced a weekly production of 85,000 board <br />feet, mostly box car decking. The 52-inch diameter saw could <br />easily slice through the 20-inch old-growth longleaf pine. <br />Joe only moved the mill twice, and the race with the waters <br />would be won as the land was stripped of its carpet of green </div></div><br />10 Wiregrass Fall 2011 </div></div><br />gold; by 1953 when Estes sold his mills, the land would be <br />waiting for the water.” <br />Of course, mergers and acquisitions over the next few </div></div><br />decades resulted in fewer sawmills, and fewer trees to cut, <br />and by 1967, all but one Decatur County mill had closed. But <br />by that time, J.E. had cut every stick of lumber—himself, for <br />his first home with his wife, Patty, who passed away this <br />year after more than 61 years of marriage. When sawmilling <br />ended, J.E. decided he wanted to own his own service station. <br />After all, as a youngster, he had worked at one washing cars <br />on Saturdays, and liked the idea of being his own boss. Even <br />after being told he wasn’t cut out for the job, J.E. didn’t give <br />up. He’s not wired that way. <br />“My philosophy is to get the job done, whatever it </div></div><br />takes,” J.E. said. And over the years, he’s bought his own land, <br />planted his own trees, and managed a business the way he <br />thought best. <br />“My integrity and my honor and my word—those are the </div></div><br />things that are most important to me,” J.E. said. “These are <br />the things that have guided me my entire life.” <br />From the service station to the sawmills to being an en- </div></div><br />trepreneur. So much has changed in the last eight decades. Yet <br />for J.E. Sharber, a good day’s work is still what matters most. </div>
