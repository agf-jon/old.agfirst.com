For Georgia growers,&#x0A;that’s great news, because&#x0A;with global demand on the&#x0A;rise, and prices reaching their&#x0A;peak here at home, the longterm&#x0A;expectation for Georgia&#x0A;pecans is outstanding.&#x0A;“Ten years ago, I don’t&#x0A;to China grew from 1.8 million pounds of pecans to 88&#x0A;million pounds. And according to the U.S. Department&#x0A;of Agriculture, prices for pecans in the shell have nearly&#x0A;doubled over the last three years.&#x0A;Why the demand? In China, pecans are considered a&#x0A;Rob Cohen, a grower in&#x0A;southwest Georgia and&#x0A;northwest Florida, checks&#x0A;his pecan tree nursery in&#x0A;Decatur County.&#x0A;think anyone saw this coming,” said Marty Harrell,&#x0A;President of the National Pecan Shellers’ Association and&#x0A;Chief Executive Officer and Principal Founder of Harrell&#x0A;Nut Company in Camilla. The Chinese call the pecan ‘the&#x0A;food for long life.’ The goal is to gain a foothold in the world&#x0A;market.”&#x0A;Over the course of the last five years, China’s imports&#x0A;of pecans have grown to nearly one-quarter of the U.S.&#x0A;pecan crop. In a four-year span, 2005 to 2009, exports&#x0A;delicacy. Most Chinese purchase them roasted and salted&#x0A;still in the shell. Sometimes, they are pickled. Packaged&#x0A;in little cellophane bags, pecans—marketed as a healthy&#x0A;snack—have become the “snack of choice” for Chinese&#x0A;citizens who have more disposable income than ever before.&#x0A;Combine that with the idea that pecans are associated with&#x0A;longevity, a concept deeply engrained in Chinese culture,&#x0A;and you have a highly marketable product.&#x0A;And the foreign market is driving the kinds of varieties&#x0A;planted here, according to Rob Cohen, who, along with&#x0A;his brother, Eric, grow pecans on nearly 1,000 acres in&#x0A;southwest Georgia and north Florida.&#x0A;find ways to increase yield and&#x0A;meet the demand.”&#x0A;ROB COHEN&#x0A;“We’re constantly trying to&#x0A;Jeanne and Marty Harrell of Harrell Nut Company in&#x0A;Camilla, at the Worldwide Food Expo in Germany in October,&#x0A;promoting U.S. pecans.&#x0A;xt pag&#x0A;Southwest Georgia&#x0A;Expanding Export Markets Mean Profits For Area Pecan Growers&#x0A;China and India.&#x0A;If you’re a pecan grower&#x0A;in the state of Georgia, you&#x0A;might know more about&#x0A;India and China than you&#x0A;ever thought you would.&#x0A;These two emerging markets&#x0A;have analysts projecting&#x0A;that demand for pecans will&#x0A;exceed supply over the long&#x0A;term.

As the international markets continue to expand,&#x0A;Cohen, who has also participated in TEPAP, Texas A&amp;M&#x0A;University’s agricultural business management program&#x0A;which is sponsored by Farm Credit, is hoping to learn&#x0A;everything he can to take advantage of growing demand.&#x0A;“Desirables” are just that for the Chinese – who value the nut’s&#x0A;healthy qualities.&#x0A;ass F&#x0A;, Nature’s Finest Foods&#x0A;explained. “They shake out of the trees earlier and they&#x0A;fetch a premium price domestically and in foreign markets.&#x0A;They are&#x0A;</page>

Federal laws will&#x0A;change January 1, 2012, disallowing many of the favorable&#x0A;tax provisions currently in place. This year, the&#x0A;value of a perpetual conservation easement donated&#x0A;to a land trust or governmental unit can be deducted&#x0A;as a charitable contribution up to 50% of the donor’s&#x0A;adjusted gross income.&#x0A;In 2012, deductions will be&#x0A;limited to 30% of AGI with a five-year carry forward.&#x0A;</page>
    <page p="9">THE AGRICULTURE EXPERIENCE&#x0A;Step Up and Be a Leader&#x0A;While listening to side conversations traveling through&#x0A;airports, discussion at producer seminars, and at the community&#x0A;church picnic, everyone is asking, “Where has the&#x0A;leadership gone?” Whether you flip on cable television, or&#x0A;follow the soap opera politics playing out at all levels, leadership&#x0A;is being questioned.&#x0A;Society and the world have become more fragmented&#x0A;by information and technology, which tends to create a loss&#x0A;of focus. In a world where economic volatility and speed&#x0A;of change are accelerating, the opportunities for success&#x0A;are plentiful; however, the opportunities for failure are also&#x0A;abundant. Proactive, strong leadership is essential to maintain&#x0A;focus.&#x0A;Leaders at All Levels&#x0A;Leadership can be demonstrated in many forms at all&#x0A;levels given the situation or timing of an event. For some,&#x0A;leadership is shown by providing guidance to a 4-H project&#x0A;or FFA event, supporting the local rescue squad, or coaching&#x0A;a football or basketball league. Serving on church, community,&#x0A;or agricultural boards, or representing your industry&#x0A;locally, regionally, or nationally can be a context for leadership.&#x0A;Often an unusual event or emergency brings out&#x0A;the best leadership qualities of everyday normal people.&#x0A;However, for many the day-to-day interaction with family,&#x0A;employees, suppliers, and the community shows evidence&#x0A;of leadership and focus on success.&#x0A;Great leadership is built on the art of communicating a&#x0A;vision, core value, or principle. Moreover, it involves inspiring&#x0A;a person or group of people with common values and&#x0A;ideals to create and pursue within their personal skill sets.&#x0A;The “Why” Connection&#x0A;The foundation of great leadership is the “why” con-&#x0A;nection. I recently watched a video of Simon Sinek on the&#x0A;TEDTalks YouTube Channel in which he explained how&#x0A;leaders inspire action through the power of “why.” (http://&#x0A;youtu.be/qp0HIF3SfI4) The main idea of his message was&#x0A;that people connect with you when they believe what you&#x0A;believe, or have a similar purpose, motivation, or “why.”&#x0A;After sharing this video at a strategic planning conference&#x0A;of an agricultural cooperative, I asked the group a simple&#x0A;question. Why do you work for this particular agricultural&#x0A;cooperative? Many in the group thought responses would&#x0A;be picking up a paycheck or providing for the family.&#x0A;To everyone’s surprise, we received a different set of&#x0A;responses. Many felt that it was empowering to work with&#x0A;farms engaged in producing food, fiber and fuel for a growing&#x0A;world population. Others stated they enjoyed having&#x0A;coworkers with similar beliefs and a work environment&#x0A;that is like family. Some stated their lives are enriched by&#x0A;the challenge and fun of helping agricultural producers&#x0A;solve problems. One person stated that he enjoys working&#x0A;in this business because the people are more important&#x0A;than the quarterly financial bottom line. The special relationships&#x0A;that they have with their customers rank much&#x0A;higher than a paycheck.&#x0A;By Dr&#x0A;. David Kohl&#x0A;The leadership of this management team suddenly&#x0A;realized that the connection between employees and customers&#x0A;who have very similar “whys” set them beyond the&#x0A;status quo of the competition. Knowing the “whys” took&#x0A;them to another level. As a matter of fact, this organization&#x0A;now has established a “why statement” that speaks&#x0A;from the heart and goes beyond the traditional mission, vision,&#x0A;and core values. The same can apply to your situation&#x0A;whether it is work, family, or a community setting. Effective&#x0A;leaders are able to connect with people who have a similar&#x0A;purpose, cause or belief.&#x0A;Key Elements of Leadership&#x0A;Over the years I have been in a position to exam-&#x0A;ine many outstanding leaders while involved in athletics,&#x0A;teaching, and facilitating numerous agricultural groups.&#x0A;The following list, though not exhaustive, provides key elements&#x0A;of leadership that I have observed.&#x0A;• Building a team on a single purpose, vision, and focus&#x0A;• Knowing how to gain commitment of others with goals&#x0A;and actions&#x0A;• Creating an environment of empowerment&#x0A;• Thinking and acting independently and creatively, but&#x0A;also gaining consensus with balanced input&#x0A;• Remaining believable and positive, while understanding&#x0A;the capabilities of others&#x0A;• Praising, reinforcing, critiquing, and sometimes working&#x0A;through others as agents of change&#x0A;• Making others better, lifting, and enriching lives&#x0A;Many great leaders never forget their roots; they are hum-&#x0A;ble and always remember the people who got them where&#x0A;they are today. Good leaders tend to be superior listeners and&#x0A;observers of people’s verbal and nonverbal communication.&#x0A;They know how to motivate others and realize that each individual&#x0A;is unique, having special experiences and talents that, if&#x0A;unlocked, can make them blossom. Outstanding leaders never&#x0A;forget that change starts bottom-up, not top-down, and they&#x0A;value people and input from the front lines.&#x0A;What is fun to observe about great leaders is some are&#x0A;fiery like Bob Knight, while others are quiet and subtle, but&#x0A;passionate. One quality that all great leaders possess is the&#x0A;ability to connect with people by establishing a common&#x0A;purpose. Sometimes leaders can be subservient, or engaged&#x0A;with people in an activity side-by-side, “walking the talk.”&#x0A;However, they are keen on the art of connecting with the&#x0A;minds and the hearts of others to further a common cause&#x0A;with balance and common sense.&#x0A;Agriculture and rural America have many of the old-&#x0A;time values that have made America great. It is up to all of&#x0A;us to be advocates for our industry and cultivate an environment&#x0A;that sets us beyond the status quo. Being leaders by&#x0A;connecting and communicating the “whys” from our dayto-day&#x0A;tasks on farms to working with families, employees,&#x0A;consumers, and stakeholders in our industry is imperative&#x0A;to lead the industry forward. Agriculture has been and will&#x0A;always be the foundation of the pyramid of success of our&#x0A;country. Are you ready to step up and be a leader?&#x0A;Wiregrass Fall 2011&#x0A;9&#x0A;</page>
    <page p="10">AT HOME IN RURAL AMERICA&#x0A;JE Sharber Remembers Decatur&#x0A;County’s Sawmilling Past&#x0A;There are some in these parts who might think of pine&#x0A;trees as lacking aesthetic beauty, preferring to see only the&#x0A;dollars associated with this gift of Nature. But for those who&#x0A;saw both—the beauty and the economic potential, pine forests&#x0A;that stretched from Decatur and Thomas and Seminoles&#x0A;counties to the Gulf of Mexico represented a way of life—a&#x0A;recreational paradise and a source of economic stability for&#x0A;the first half of the 20th century.&#x0A;What’s left of that era are a few companies, Elberta Crate&#x0A;and Box Company in Bainbridge being one, a relic of the sawmilling&#x0A;days remembered by a few gentlemen who brought&#x0A;the sawmill industry to life. J.E. Sharber is one of those men.&#x0A;Sawmill Industry Brought&#x0A;Economic Prosperity to the Region&#x0A;There aren’t many business people in Decatur County&#x0A;who haven’t heard of Joe (JE) Sharber. Over the course of&#x0A;eight decades, Mr. Sharber has been influential in the business&#x0A;community, with the running of his own business, Sharber&#x0A;Oil, and as a trusted voice of reason.&#x0A;Mr. Sharber’s experiences in the sawmill and timber&#x0A;business aren’t unique in these parts—but his work ethic and&#x0A;commitment to small town values might be. Once graduated&#x0A;from high school JE set out to work his way up in the pine forests&#x0A;surrounding Bainbridge and Seminole County, running a&#x0A;sawmill and logging company for a number of years. Working&#x0A;for the L.P. Estes sawmill, J.E. quickly moved up the ranks,&#x0A;at a time when our nation had an insatiable appetite for lumber&#x0A;due to the war.&#x0A;In fact, L.P. Estes’ sawmill was one of the&#x0A;first to use a portable sawmill, perfect in many ways, but one&#x0A;of the most important being that it would save on transportation&#x0A;costs. From the booklet, “The story of Decatur County’s&#x0A;Carpet of Green Gold,” local author Mayo Livingston, Jr.,&#x0A;writes: “At the management helm of this “pepper-box” mill&#x0A;was a young teenager named James “Joe” Sharber. His fires of&#x0A;ambition and strong work ethics would be formulated during&#x0A;those years as he orchestrated the operations of the mill.&#x0A;The stillness of the early morning would be shattered when&#x0A;Joe would bring to life the giant diesel engine know as Buda.&#x0A;It would be the roar of the diesel and the scream of the saw&#x0A;that could be heard during the 10-hour work days.&#x0A;“With Joe as the conductor and the diesel and saw fur-&#x0A;nishing the music, the players of the orchestra would be the&#x0A;sawyer, log turners, slab trippers, edger man, deck hand and&#x0A;two men to handle the green lumber. From this orchestra&#x0A;would be produced a weekly production of 85,000 board&#x0A;feet, mostly box car decking. The 52-inch diameter saw could&#x0A;easily slice through the 20-inch old-growth longleaf pine.&#x0A;Joe only moved the mill twice, and the race with the waters&#x0A;would be won as the land was stripped of its carpet of green&#x0A;10 Wiregrass Fall 2011&#x0A;gold; by 1953 when Estes sold his mills, the land would be&#x0A;waiting for the water.”&#x0A;Of course, mergers and acquisitions over the next few&#x0A;decades resulted in fewer sawmills, and fewer trees to cut,&#x0A;and by 1967, all but one Decatur County mill had closed. But&#x0A;by that time, J.E. had cut every stick of lumber—himself, for&#x0A;his first home with his wife, Patty, who passed away this&#x0A;year after more than 61 years of marriage. When sawmilling&#x0A;ended, J.E. decided he wanted to own his own service station.&#x0A;After all, as a youngster, he had worked at one washing cars&#x0A;on Saturdays, and liked the idea of being his own boss. Even&#x0A;after being told he wasn’t cut out for the job, J.E. didn’t give&#x0A;up. He’s not wired that way.&#x0A;“My philosophy is to get the job done, whatever it&#x0A;takes,” J.E. said. And over the years, he’s bought his own land,&#x0A;planted his own trees, and managed a business the way he&#x0A;thought best.&#x0A;“My integrity and my honor and my word—those are the&#x0A;things that are most important to me,” J.E. said. “These are&#x0A;the things that have guided me my entire life.”&#x0A;From the service station to the sawmills to being an en-&#x0A;trepreneur. So much has changed in the last eight decades. Yet&#x0A;for J.E. Sharber, a good day’s work is still what matters most.&#x0A;</page>
