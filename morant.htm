                  travel frequently throughout the country in my job.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                  </span>I meet with banks, insurance companies and other
                  organizations with units dedicated to lending to
                  agribusinesses to familiarize them with AgFirst’s capital

                  </span>My career path was a non-traditional one for a
                  commercial lender.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>I began working in banking with NationsBank as what is now
                  known as a personal banker, opening accounts at a branch.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>After exceeding the branch’s annual sales goals within a
                  matter of months, I felt like I needed a larger challenge.</font></p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3">The bank then
                  allowed me to move into middle-market commercial lending.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                  </span>While the arena is different, the role of business
                  development officer is a natural next step from being a
                  commercial lending officer.</font></p>
                  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3">My academic
                  background wasn’t heavily influenced by banking and finance.
                  I have a bachelor’s degree in psychology.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                  </span>I understand people and am a natural salesperson, and
                  if I believe in the benefit of a product or service then I can
                  make a customer believe as well.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
                  </span>That’s been the key to my success.</font></p>

                  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3">The capital
                  markets unit is responsible for serving food and agribusiness
                  companies in the United States whose credit transactions

                  <p class="MsoNormal"><font face="Arial" size="3">My job
                  ultimately benefits their bottom line.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

                  shared with the Farm Credit associations affiliated with
                  AgFirst.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These
                  associations, in turn, share their earnings with their
                  farmer-borrowers through patronage dividends, thus reducing
                  the borrowing costs for those farmers, landowners and others.</font></p>
